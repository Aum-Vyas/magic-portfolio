## Case Study

### Problem & Goals
- Wanted a fast, scriptable torrent client without GUI overhead.
- Goals: minimal deps, clear progress, pause/resume, safe defaults.

### Architecture
- Rust CLI using async runtime; modular layers for protocol, session, and UI.
- BitTorrent engine wrapper; file I/O with buffered writes and integrity checks.

### Implementation Highlights
- Resumable sessions via state snapshots (pieces, peers, priorities).
- TUI-friendly output with throttled updates; JSON mode for scripting.
- Rate limiter and disk preallocation to avoid fragmentation.

### Challenges
- Peer choking/unchoking heuristics; tuned for fairness and throughput.
- Handling partial files on abrupt exits; added atomic checkpoints.

### Outcomes
- Stable downloads with predictable speeds; low CPU/memory footprint.
- Easy to embed in scripts for automation.

### Next Steps
- Magnet link support improvements; add selective file download and TUI.

## Overview

Ascii converts images into stylized ASCII art using Python. It supports adjustable resolution and character sets and can export the output as text.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Media

## Case Study

### Problem & Goals
- Convert images into readable ASCII art with tunable density and palettes.
- Goals: simple UI, predictable output width, fast processing.

### Architecture
- Python pipeline: load image -> grayscale -> block sampling -> char mapping.
- CLI/UI wrapper; exports to text file.

### Implementation Highlights
- Character ramp tuned by luminance; optional color ANSI for terminals.
- Aspect-ratio correction to account for character cell dimensions.
- Batch mode for folders; progress output for large images.

### Challenges
- Balancing detail vs. noise; added adaptive sampling and dithering toggle.

### Outcomes
- Clean output for portraits and logos at small sizes.

### Next Steps
- Add web UI and live preview; support GIF to ASCII animation.

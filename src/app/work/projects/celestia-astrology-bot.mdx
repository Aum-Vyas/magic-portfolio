## Case Study

### Problem & Goals
- Provide approachable astrology insights via chat with controllable tone and citation.
- Goals: helpful answers, transparent sources, low latency.

### Architecture
- Next.js frontend with streaming responses.
- Gemini model for reasoning; prompt templates for safety and persona.
- Supabase for auth, message history, and rate limiting.

### Implementation Highlights
- Conversation memory window per user; semantic truncation when long.
- Guardrails on input (toxicity/PII) and output (hallucination prompts with citations).
- Caching frequent queries to reduce tokens/latency.

### Challenges
- Balancing creativity vs. factual tone; tuned via system prompts and temperature.
- Handling ambiguous birth data; added follow-up question flow.

### Outcomes
- Higher user satisfaction in usability tests; median response time under 1.8s with cache hits.
- Clear groundwork for daily horoscopes and notifications.

### Next Steps
- Add user profiles with saved charts; experiment with structured tool calls.

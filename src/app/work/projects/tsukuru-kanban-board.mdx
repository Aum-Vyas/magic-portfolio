## Case Study

### Problem & Goals
- Needed a lightweight, collaborative task board with simple auth and realtime updates.
- Goals: fast UX, drag-and-drop, multi-list boards, low setup.

### Architecture
- Next.js (App Router) UI with server actions for CRUD.
- Supabase for Postgres, Auth, and Realtime channels.
- Columnar schema: `boards`, `lists`, `cards`, with RLS policies.

### Implementation Highlights
- Optimistic UI for card create/move; reconcile via realtime updates.
- Accessible drag-and-drop; keyboard navigation for card moves.
- Row-level security using user/board membership.

### Challenges
- Avoiding reorder flicker across clients; solved with stable sort keys and debounced broadcasts.
- RLS edge cases on shared boards; added explicit membership checks.

### Outcomes
- Smooth multi-user interactions; minimal latency under realtime traffic.
- Clear foundation for labels, due dates, and attachments.

### Next Steps
- Add board sharing links, comments, and activity log.
